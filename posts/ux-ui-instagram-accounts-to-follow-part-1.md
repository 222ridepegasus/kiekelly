Instagram is the only social media platform I use these days having pretty much abandoned Facebook and Twitter a few years back (time and toxicity).

Whilst I still think Instagram = procrastination, it can be tailored to serve up interesting content (aside from your social circle). In my case this relates to UX and UI, or design in general. However, you really need to drill through to find such material as the feeds are seemingly awash with questionable, regurgitated posts that swirl around and around, never vanishing down the proverbial plughole.

Fear not, as help is at hand to scythe the chaff. Here's my selection of useful UX/UI accounts to follow:

Dutch UX Designer Robin van Zessen has meticulously curated a large selection of posts that span from UX principles and terminology through to hundreds design resources and even some extremely bad design jokes. In truth there are hundreds of accounts like Robin's, but few are as well considered.

Robin packages content in simple and friendly manner that's unpretentious and easily digestible. Suitable for beginners ands grizzled old veterans alike, if there's one pick of the bunch I'd recommend, it's this one.

**Zander Whitehurst**

There's not doubt about it, Figma is the greatest invention of the last 20 years. So, what better way for modern attention-drifting brains to learn the tool than a series of bite-sized videos, courtesy of British UX/UI Designer Zander Whitehurst.

As his 150,000+ follower count suggests, Zander's pretty much cornered the market here. I learnt quite a few tricks, and even if videos are not always relevant, the infectious, if cheesy, energy is compelling.

**ui.interceptor**

UI interceptor fashions itself as a UI Design Magazine and posts daily design inspirations, it's mainly app focussed but occasionally serves web showcases.

The standard is solid, but in truth a search through Behance or Dribbble could yield better designed content. The point here however is that you experience a constant stream of on-trend content, think of it as a UI style barometer for the subconscious.

As showcased designs are often entirely UI fluff, it's also good to scan with an objective UX eye. Often showcased material, though evidently pretty, simply wouldn't work in the real world.

I guess what I find most interesting here then is the chance to quickly refine or reinforce your own design ideologies, a 5 second scan, process, and move on.
