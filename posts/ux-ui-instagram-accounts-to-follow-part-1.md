Instagram is the social media platform I use these days having pretty much abandoned Facebook and Twitter a few years back (time and toxicity). 

Whilst I still think Instagram = procrastination, it can be tailored to serve up interesting content (aside from your social circle). In my case this relates to UX and UI, or design in general. However, you really need to drill through to find such material as the feeds are seemingly awash with questionable, regurgitated posts that swirl around and around, never vanishing down the proverbial plughole.

Help, however is at hand to scythe the chaff, here's my selection of useful UX/UI accounts to follow:

1. **ux.robin**  
     
   ![](/img/2021/12/07/robin-_van_zessen.png)  
   Dutch UX Designer Robin van Zessen has meticulously curated a large selection of posts that span from UX principles and terminology through to hundreds design resources and even some extremely bad design jokes. In truth there are hundreds of accounts like Robin's, but few are as well considered.  
     
   Robins packages content in simple and  friendly manner that's both unpretentious and easily digestible. Suitable for beginners ands grizzled old veterans alike, if there's one pick of the bunch I'd recommend the most it's this one.  
     
   Follow Robin at: [instagram.com/ux.robin/]()
2. **Zander Whitehurst

   **There's not doubt about it, Figma is the greatest invention of the last 20 years. So, what better way for the modern attention-drifting brain to learn the tool than a series of bite-sized '_Supafast'_ videos, courtesy of British UX/UI Designer Zander Whitehurst.  
     
   As his 150,000 follower count suggests, Zander's pretty much cornered the market here. I learnt quite a few tricks, and even if not always relevant his infectious, if cheesy, energy is compelling.  
     
   Follow Zander at [instagram.com/zanderwhitehurst/](https://www.instagram.com/zanderwhitehurst/ "https://www.instagram.com/zanderwhitehurst/") and also check out his recently launched school of UX/UI [www.memorisely.com](https://www.memorisely.com "https://www.memorisely.com").
3. **ui.interceptor  
     
   ![](/img/2021/12/07/ui_interceptor.png)  
     
   **UI interceptor fashions itself as a UI Design Magazine and posts daily showcased inspirations daily app and occasionally web inspirations,.   
     
   The standard is solid, but In truth a search through Behance or Dribbble could yield better designed content. The point here however is that you experience constant stream of on-trend content, think of it as a UI style barometer for the subconscious.  
     
   Side note: Why are so many fictitious designs focussed on either selling sneakers, monitoring bitcoin or forecasting the weather? I mean, why has nobody designed an app to help lonely French scientists track the movement of feral cats on the [Kerguelen Islands]()  ?
