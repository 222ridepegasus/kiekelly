### **iOS or Android?**

A bottomless cauldron of subjective debate. As a Mac user I've always leaned to the prior, thought honestly, I'm not particularly fussy as I dont see phones as anything more than a utility these days.

Indeed, in an effort to once again be more platform-agnostic I switched to Android at the start of the year.  Tbh, I really don't mind, especially considering the price difference (I run a budget Pixel 3a) but I do miss the regimented simplicity of iOS.

So it is then, here begins a chronicle of Android's good, bad and and ugly...

### 1. Help! I'm stuck on the notification screen

My device recently updated to Android v12, which was kinda weird as it just happened, rather than a considered action on iOS (maybe its my settings). Anyway, it's a fairly radical visual shift, definitely for the better. However, this certainly left me perplexed:

It took me forever to notice the 'home' button here (white with small drop shadow) and then I was still confused as the audio widget play button sits directly below. Now, whilst the play button sitting directly underneath is surely an edge case the fact that the home button is barely visible isn't...

We'll put this one down to teething trouble.
